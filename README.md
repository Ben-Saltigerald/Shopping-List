# Shopping-List
I have created a grocery shopping list to make planning my grocery shopping a little more conveinent. 
This list includes the following: 

- A display of common items that I include in my grocery shopping are displayed along with a number next to each item (1-18). Items can be selected form this list by inputting their corresponding item number.
- Items may also be added to the list if there are any additional items needed that are not included in the list of common items. 
- Once the list has been selected, the user is prompted to select the quantity for each item. 
- The final list of items is displayed along with the quantity of each item.
